A project created to display a visual tool to simulate resource allocation graphs and analyze deadlock scenarios interactively.

## **FEATURES**
-This project enables users to enter process and number of resources they wish to add. It then generates an RAG Graph for the user. 
-The graph has red edges if a deadlock is detected, and black edges if the system is free of deadlock. Additionally, the graph also tells you whether the system is in safe state or not using basics of Banker's Algorithm. 
-The program also incorporates basic AI technologies (API KEYS), although not added in the github due to safety and privacy reasons (It will be shown during the presentation). Adding the API Key tells the user which cycle should be broken in case of a deadlock.

## **LIBRARIES**
The language of implementation has been chosen as Python as it offers extensive libraries for GUI as well as backend. Libraries like Tkinter, PyQt and networkX has been put to use

## **CONCLUSION**
This project has been very challenging yet interesting for us. We hope you enjoy its experience as much as we did making it!
